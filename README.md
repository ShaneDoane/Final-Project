Predicting March Madness games with machine learning

Our Project Proposal: We are going to use a college basketball dataset to predict which team is most likely to win in a head to head match in the March Madness competition.  We'll compare features such as historic rankings and average points, rebounds, and turnovers per game to predict this probability.
