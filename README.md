# Final-Project
Predicting March Madness games with machine learning

## Proposal
We are going to use a group of college basketball datasets to predict which team is most likely to win in a head to head match in the March Madness competition.  We'll compare features such as historic rankings and average points, rebounds, and turnovers per game to predict this probability.

## Communication 
We will use Slack for team communications. Google Drive will house our data files, due to GitHub file size constraints.
